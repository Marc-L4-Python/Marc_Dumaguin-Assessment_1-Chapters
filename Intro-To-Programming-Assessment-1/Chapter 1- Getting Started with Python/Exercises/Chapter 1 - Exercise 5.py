import math
r = float (input('Enter radius of a Circle: '))

print(float(math. pi*r**2))


# This program/code solves for the area of a circle.
# It accepts/asks the user to input a number for the radius of the circle 
# and then solves it using the "Area of A Circle" formula.
# Again, the "import" function lets the code have an access of another code from another module.
