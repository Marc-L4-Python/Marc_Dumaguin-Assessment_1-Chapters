# Assigned a favorite number (value) to the variable "favorite_number" and created a "msg" variable to
# say a message that includes my favorite number. 

# Used the f-string within the "msg" variable so whenever the value of "favorite_number" is changed, 
# the "msg" variable keeps the message and the number is only added/changed (as a string because of the f-string function)
# into the message. Then, prints the message with the favorite number.
